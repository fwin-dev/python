1. November 12, 2013: `Python OO #1.pptx`
	* These slides were made to explain how to model a real world scenario using objected oriented programming concepts, which will come in handy in most any type of programming you'd be interested in. Slides were reviewed some but may not be fully accurate; however, the ideas and methodologies are there.
